## Setup

Currently, `main.py` only scrapes for the https://www.ymcacny.org/program-search site. The iframe issue has a workaround, but there is a bug in the current scraping mechanism. Currently, we aren't able to scrape the location or description properly, but this should be quickly fixable. json file of the current run has been provided! Will fix asap.

`python -m venv .venv`

`source .venv/bin/activate`

`pip install requirements.txt`
